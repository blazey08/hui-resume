      "My first internship experience which I went in equipped with only school knowledge, I spent my time in iTrust developing a website that was used in their annual CTF event - CISS. Through this internship, I got my foot into the coding industry by constructing the website in a simple Flask (Python), HTML, CSS stack\
      coupled with a lightweight sqlite database as the local storage. At the same time, I managed to learn about the world of CTFs and white hat hacking which was overall a very enjoyable and interesting experience.",

      "The next summer was spent exploring the engineering aspect of my degree with AMD - a powerhouse in the semiconductor industry. At AMD, I was exposed to their product testing lifecycles and practices. During my time there, I also found various ways to automate some otherwise tedious process by writing scripts and\
      streamlining process flows to make knowledge transfer easier for future batches. However, it was slightly unfortunate that my exposure to the hardware side of things was limited by the existence of COVID-19 and circuit breaker. In the end though, it was a really enjoyable experience that really opened my eyes to the industry.",

      "During my final term in SUTD, I took on a part time internship with Bytedance where I supported Data Infrastructure as part of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). This internship allowed me to tap on all my past experiences as dealing with VMs required me to tap on my linux and hardware knowledge while the constant development\
      of quality of life tools, automated flows and monitoring streams alowed me to capitalize on my coding skills. Overall, it was a truly fruitful experience where I can say I got to do the best of both worlds.",
